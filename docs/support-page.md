# Support page

The support page puts the monthly development goal, donation amounts, and Ko-fi / PayPal links first. Selecting an amount carries it into PayPal; Ko-fi lets you choose the amount on its own page. No checkout opens until you choose a provider.

Star and community links offer other ways to help. Sponsors remain visible. The Electron page uses the official VoiceStudio logo, a single donation panel, visible sponsor and Pro cards, and an icon grid for contact channels. No accordion hides those actions. Controls support keyboard navigation, and decorative interaction animations respect reduced-motion preferences.

Workspace headers link to Support immediately before Search. A sponsor footer sits below each workspace content area, outside its scrolling editor and above the agent dock. It reads the shared sponsor roster, uses themed hover/focus tooltips, and opens sponsor links in the system browser. With an empty roster, one combined “Your logo here” booking tile demonstrates the placement and opens the sponsorship message form. It prepares a mailto draft to partner@voicestudio.sh in the default email app, or copies the address; it never sends email itself.

The sponsor-bar remove control opens the Free vs Pro comparison on Support. The comparison lists the proposed Pro benefits: no telemetry, a hideable sponsor bar, a Pro badge, and advanced tools. Activation verification and the specific advanced-tool list are not configured; no Pro entitlement is inferred from donations or local preferences.

Sponsor tiles form a left-aligned, horizontally scrolling row with 1px gaps. The rightmost combined logo-plus tile opens the booking form.

Logo hover cards match their trigger tile width and grow vertically to fit their contents.

The footer chevron opens a searchable sponsor catalog above the strip. Cards show logos, names, tiers, and destination links; a booking card opens the email form. The panel scrolls within 60% of the viewport. Escape or the close button collapses it and returns focus to the chevron.

The expanded catalog is labeled Integrations. Entries from the sponsored roster display a Featured badge in their catalog card and hover card; the empty booking preview does not.

Ten voice-AI company examples populate the catalog and compact strip using locally bundled official icons. They carry a Directory example label, not Featured. Capabilities and source links are recorded in [the directory notes](integration-directory.md).
